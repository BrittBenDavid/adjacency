This program defines a variable of the adjmat type (an instance of an NxN-sized neighborhood matrix).
The program gets a list of values for the matrix members from the user and print the matrix in a two-dimensional view.

The project was written as part of the "Systems Programming Lab" course as part of my degree (Computer Science at the Open University). C language in Linux operating system.
